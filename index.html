                <br>
                <p style = "font-size: 50px;">I am a second year student at Stony Brook University majoring in computer science. Currently, I am working to explore different programming languages such JavaScript along with HTML and CSS, in the hopes of becoming a full-stack software developer. I also have been dabbling with various test projects using APIs and been trying to also launch a Discord bot using Java libraries. Game development also interests me and I hope to be able to delve deeper into that after learning more languages. As of now, I am seeking internships, to not only gain experience with working with new technologies, but to also gain collaborative skills as I've had fairly limited amounts of experience in the past. I am very open to improving my repertoire of skills as a software developer.</p>
